# Embracing Diversity in all its Forms


## Overall ideas

* Diversity in beliefs. Being open minded. Walking the fine line between
  not being too sure of yourself and not believing concretely in anything. If
  you are 100% sure about everything you believe, you can never be taught
  anything.

* To the extent that I've been more able to have an open heart and mind, I've
  felt it easier to have love for my fellow beings and to feel the Spirit in
  my life.

* [2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32)
  black and white, bond and free.

* What is diversity really about? What does it mean to embrace it?

* Embracing diversity is huge today, especially in the workplace.
  * Find some quotes

* We don't really want equal representation; we want equal opportunity.

* To want equal representation is to say all races and genders are exactly the
  same. I think a big reason the secular world yearns for this to be true,
  is that they want everyone to be equal, but don't have a universal
  measuring stick that gives the same results for every person, so they
  invent it. They pretend a person from any race, gender, or social
  background can jump the same height, perform the same on tests, and have
  the same capacity for nurturing. We don't have that constraint, because
  our universal measuring stick is God's love. I can be dumber than you,
  but still have a firm conviction of my own self worth because I know how
  much heavenly father loves me.


## Diversity of Beliefs

* We tend to think of certain issues as 100% black and white. Like abortion.
  it's easy to say that abortion is 100% wrong every time and that it is
  a completely undefendable practice from a moral point of view. I would
  say that's pretty much what I used to believe. But then I lived in a place
  where most people hold the complete opposite point of view. At that point
  I had a choice: I could either believe all of those people were without
  morals, or I could try to understand why they feel the way they do. I
  chose the latter, and I came away with a much greater appreciation
  of how complicated issues like this are and how difficult it can be to come
  to a clear moral answer. It's situations like this that I'm grateful that
  the Church does have policies for us to follow. But the Church can't have
  a policy for every issue or every situation, and that's where an
  appreciation for diverse opinions and beliefs can help us make better
  moral decisions.


## Diversity of race

* Quote Elder Ballard: We know the leaders are fallable, but only the Gospel
  can lead to eternal life.

* Racism is alive and well. It definitely still exists in blatant forms, but
  I think that possibly the more dangerous form is when we think we're not
  racist at all. We have a tendency to think we live in the time that has
  "arrived" morally, that nothing as bad as the mistakes of the past could
  happen in our generation. I hate to break it to you, but we have our own
  Mountain Meadows, our own lynchings, our own ..., and in 200 years people
  will look back and wonder how we ever could have done things we think
  are totally ok today.
