# Embracing Diversity in all its Forms

## Introduction

* I'm Anders Pitman
* Topic is Embracing...
* Humor is my comfort zone.
* We have 2 problems
  1. I used all my jokes last time
  2. I have strong feelings about a lot of things related to this topic, so
     it's hard to be lighthearted about it.
* My goal is not to offend people. 
* I consider myself a moderate, socially and politically. My democrat friends 
  think I'm a bigot, and my
  republican friends think I'm a heretic, so there's no way to win.
* I want to provoke thought. If anything I say
  makes you feel like I'm judging you, or there's something wrong with you,
  then I have failed, so
  please come talk to me so I can learn how to better communicate.
* Just know that these thoughts come from my heart, and I'm still tring to
  figure out a lot of this for myself. This is kind of a snapshot of my
  progression.

## Key things I want to hit on
* The goal is for all of God's children to keep his commandments, return to
  him, and to become like him.
* As hard as it is to believe sometimes, I find that people almost always
  have good reasons for what they do and believe. To the extent that I take
  the time to understand their context, I've been more able to understand why
  they think the way they do.

## What is diversity, and why should we care about it?

### Diversity deals with how different things are.

#### Biological Diversity
* I'm a software engineer, and I specialize in biology. The scientists that
  I work with are very interested in phylogenetic diversity.
* One thing we've known for a long time, is that if you don't get enough
  biological diversity in a population, there can be serious health
  consequences. This is why it's illegal to marry anyone closer than your
  first cousin in most states.

#### Social Diversity
* When most people talk about diversity, they're talking about diversity
  in race, gender, sexual orientation, economic status, etc.
* People are very interested in diversity in the workplace right now, for a
  number of reasons.
  * The American business world is currently dominated by white and Asian men.
  * There's research which indicates that diversity can help
    businesses be more successful.
  * There's a moral desire for people from all backgrounds to have equal
    opportunity, and diversity is one approach to trying to measure that.
  * There's tremendous social pressure for companies to become more diverse.

#### Diversity and the Gospel
* [2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32)
  black and white, bond and free.

## My diversity story
* Raised in a republican family, in a mostly republican Church,
  in a republican town, in a replubican state.
* Came out of that situation thinking in very black and white terms.
* Was a very black and white missionary. I think that was where I first
  ran in to a lot of friction, was with my companions.
* For some reason, as human beings, we yearn for things to binary, that means
  two. We want everything to be this or that.

## Racism and sexism
* I think one of the biggest roadblocks to erraticating racism is believing
  it's not as big of a problem as it is.
* Saying, "I'm not racist" is kind of like saying, "I don't have an accent."
  Sure, when you're only around people who are just like you, you tend to
  think you don't have an accent.
