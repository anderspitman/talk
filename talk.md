      Feel strongly that we as rich American's have a moral obligation to help

# Resolutions

## 1. Avoid contention
* 6/24 quotes about contention on BrainyQuotes from Apostles
* Arguing never convinces anyone. Seriously
* Struggled with this on my mission
* Be wise in exercising our influence. Few things will build resentment faster
  than abusing a position of authority in order to get your way or force your
  opinion to be heard.

## 2. Find more meaning in temple service
* If there were more temple work done in the Church, there would be less of
  selfishness, less of contention, less of demeaning others. - President Hinckley
* Ponder the Atonement
* Bring your own family names

## 3. Take care of your body
* Spiritual dissonance and lowered self esteem

## 4. Learn more about the gospel
* Take care of the goose
    * Must find the balance between learning the gospel and living it

## 5. Be a better parent
* Obviously for most of us we should be preparing to be better parents.
* About 40 nieces and nephews.
* I have seen lots of different approaches to raising kids.
* Be thoughtful about how you plan to raise them. And do plan
    * Plan for education
    * Research different parenting techniques
    * Ask for advice
    * Do not take the goldfish approach
* Kids are hard work. It can be easy to avoid spending time with kids.
    * This is something I struggle with
    * Sit down and have a conversation with a 10 year old
    * Change some diapers
    * Offer to babysit for your siblings
    * If you don not have any nieces and nephews, you can borrow some of mine.
